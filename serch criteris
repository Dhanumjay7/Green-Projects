Hi Prabhat,

As of findings about void Void in subsequent period when previous period is still open:

1.invoice posted correctly in June. 
2.In July, there was an agent-only update that shouldn’t have affected money, but the integration resent it as a financial change.
3.Since June was still open, NetSuite added revenue again in June and posted the offset in July. 
4.So June looked too high and July too low, even though nothing really changed.

Note :  Invoice is created with two line items with different batch ids, so i thibk i need to check with micheal once in boome those batch ids avialble from  the trave come,so that we can find out thte issue.

As of my compilation :  am integration bevauior is mismatched, because if any travcome invoice is updated then it should update in the netsuite without adding any line items it should change agent id but intste of that one line aitem is added with different batch id with same 104k amount.
