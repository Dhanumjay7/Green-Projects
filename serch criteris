Hi Prabhat,

As part of our findings on “Void in subsequent period when the previous period is still open”, here’s a brief summary:

The invoice was posted correctly in June.

In July, there was an agent-only update that should not have impacted financials, but the integration resent it as a financial change.

Since June was still open, NetSuite added the revenue again in June and posted the offsetting entry in July.

As a result, June revenue appeared overstated and July understated, even though there was no actual financial change.

Additional note:
The invoice was created with two line items having different batch IDs. I believe we need to check with Michael in Boomi to confirm whether these batch IDs are coming from Travcom. This should help us identify the exact cause.

My assessment:
This appears to be an integration behavior mismatch. When a Travcom invoice is updated, NetSuite should update the existing record (for example, change the agent ID) without adding new line items. Instead, the integration is adding a new line item with a different batch ID but the same $104K amount, which is causing the revenue duplication.
