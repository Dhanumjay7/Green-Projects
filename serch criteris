Void in subsequent period when previous period is still open

We ran into an issue and wanted to make sure we understood if there is any way to stop something like this from happening.

We had an invoice that was created in Travcom on 6/6/25. This created the invoice below for $104k.

There was and adjustment in Travcom on 7/8/25 to change the agent. There should be no actual financial impact of this change. When it transferred to Netsuite, it had both an /invoice and a credit memo component. As June was still open, it added the invoice component to the existing invoice, so recorded an additional $104k of revenue in June. It created a new credit memo (below) dated 7/8/25, which posted to July for a reduction in revenue of $104k. The result was that June's revenue was too high by $104k, and July's was to low by $104k, which month to month in that account is a $204k swing.

Is there any way to stop this from happening? That created quite an issue this month, and unless I get very much more granular in my overall review, we don't currently have an easy way to catch it.
